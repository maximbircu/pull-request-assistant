Pull Request Assistant is a GitHub Action which helps automate different routines that we're usually running on Pull Requests.

Using it, you can execute commands on your Pull Request exactly the same as in a terminal. The commands could be executed by simply adding them as a comment to the Pull Request.

At the moment, there is only one command that you can use - which is [merge](documentation/commands/merge.md) and which helps you merge the PRs easier.
However, the project is based on [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander), and it's very easy to add new commands. Thus feel free
to report new issues and contribute to this awesome project.

p.s. you can set the name you like for the assistant however the default name is Friday. I consider it a 
continuation of https://github.com/maximbircu/friday :)
