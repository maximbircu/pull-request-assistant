# Quick start 

To quickly get started, just add the assistant GitHub Actions workflow to `.github/workflows/pull-request-assistant.yml`
inside the root of your repository.

   ```yaml
   name: Friday

   on:
     issue_comment:
       types: [ created ]
     pull_request_review:
       types:
         - submitted
     check_suite:
       types:
         - completed

   jobs:
     friday:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       env:
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
       steps:
         - name: SCM
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Run assistant
           uses: maximbircu/pull-request-assistant@1.0.0

           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
   ```

### Congratulations 🎉

You're done. Now to check that everything works fine just open a new Pull Request and try to run any
command by adding a comment containing `friday --help`

After a short amount of time, the command should be executed and the comment should change.
